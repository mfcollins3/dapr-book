# This program is a convenience script to start the mdbook test server for
# reviewing the book content in a web browser. The `mdbook serve` command
# will, by default, start the web server on an IPv6 address. Unfortunately,
# this has problems when using a development container as Docker only supports
# IPv4 addresses on Microsoft Windows and Apple macOS. This script will start
# the development web server on an IPv4 address so that the book can be read
# and reviewed in a web browser on the host operating system.
#
# Usage: ./serve.sh

mdbook serve -n 127.0.0.1
