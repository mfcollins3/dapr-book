# Building Microservices with Dapr

This repository contains the source content and source code for the book __Building Microservices with Dapr__. The objective of this book is to introduce other software developers, software architects, and software managers to the concepts and features supported by the Distributed Application, or [Dapr](https://dapr.io). Dapr is a project that was created by and is sponsored by [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com). Dapr provides building blocks and operational support services to Microservices while simplifying the experience of building and running microservices for software developers. Dapr is runtime and cloud agnostic, allowing the same solution to run on-premise or in cloud environments. Dapr solutions can run standalone or within Kubernetes clusters. In the cloud, Dapr solutions can run on any cloud such as Microsoft Azure or Amazon Web Services. Microsoft Azure also has a ready-to-go runtime environment for Dapr applications using [Azure Container Apps](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-apps/).

This book is being developed openly and made available for free to help the software development community and the Dapr community. I hope that by writing and sharing the content of this book that it will help and encourage more developers to use Dapr to build microservice solutions, and it will also help companies who are exploring microservice technologies to consider and adapt Dapr for the development of their next-generation solutions. By developing the book openly and publishing its content to the web to be freely available to everybody, the content will not be limited by a paywall or other blocker that might prevent others from learning from this content. Also, from what I've heard from friends, while writing a book makes them feel somewhat prestigious, I don't think I've ever met anyone who actually got rich from publishing books.
